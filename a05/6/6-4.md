## 6.4.i

Type rule tree for
```
let f x = 1 in f f end
```

`f` has type `'a -> int`

...where 'a cannot be specified any more by type inference,
since the input isn't used for anything, any operations,
that might narrow down the type, like '+' or '<' would.

## 6.4.ii

`f` has type `int -> int`

... the output is an integer,
since the then and else block should return the same type,
and 42 is an integer.
The input `x` is an integer,
since x is compared to, and also added to another integer.
