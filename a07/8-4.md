## 8.4.a
prog1.asm:
```
#0 CSTI 20000000
#2 GOTO #7
#4 CSTI 1
#6 SUB
#7 DUP
#8 IFNZRO #4
#10 STOP
```

ex8.asm:
```
#0 LDARGS
#1 CALL 0 #5
#4 STOP
#5 INCSP 1
#7 GETBP
#8 CSTI 0
#10 ADD
#11 CSTI 20000000
#13 STI
#14 INCSP -1
#16 GOTO #35
#18 GETBP
#19 CSTI 0
#21 ADD
#22 GETBP
#23 CSTI 0
#25 ADD
#26 LDI
#27 CSTI 1
#29 SUB
#30 STI
#31 INCSP -1
#33 INCSP 0
#35 GETBP
#36 CSTI 0
#38 ADD
#39 LDI
#40 IFNZRO #18
#42 INCSP -1
#44 RET -1
```

there's 4 operations in the loop of prog1
(between IFNZRO and its conditional address)
and there's 17 operations in the loop of ex8
therefore ex8 is much slower.
